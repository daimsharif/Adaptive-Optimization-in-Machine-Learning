# Adaptive Optimization in Machine Learning

This repository contains the final project for the CS7CS2: Optimisation for Machine Learning course at Trinity College Dublin for MSc in Computer science. The assignment investigates the use of Polyak's adaptive step size in mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD), comparing its performance with constant step size SGD and Adam across various learning scenarios.

## üìå Project Overview

The core goal is to evaluate the theoretical and practical behavior of adaptive step-size methods (PolyakSGD, PolyakAdam) under different settings:

- Convex regression (e.g., quadratic functions)
- Noisy linear regression
- Non-convex landscapes (two-well function)
- Realistic deep learning: Transformer model on child speech dataset

The project benchmarks optimizer behavior on convergence speed, stability, and sensitivity to batch size and gradient noise.

## üìà Key Findings

- PolyakSGD shows rapid convergence in low-noise, small-batch settings but suffers from step-size instability in high-noise scenarios.
- Adam performs robustly under noise and high-dimensional models like transformers.
- PolyakAdam's double adaptivity leads to erratic behavior in noisy conditions and underperforms others.
- In non-convex tasks, stochasticity (via small batches) is essential for escaping local minima.
